vélamál
========

A bare-bones node.js/socket.io chat server and client. Supports many state-of-the-art features, such as random nickname generation.

Edit: supports pretty much nothing except for random nickname generation.

To run:
```node velamal.js```

Vélamál operates on ```port 3000``` by default.
